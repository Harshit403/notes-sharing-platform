# Introduction

Welcome to UniNoteShare, our notes sharing platform primarily led, developed, and managed by Jiaxuan Wu. Our platform provides a centralized location for students to share academic notes and resources with each other. We created this user-friendly, efficient, and secure platform to enable students to upload, search for, and access notes related to their academic fields easily. We have implemented a front-end interface that is easy to navigate and a back-end system that can handle large amounts of data. Our search function allows users to find relevant notes quickly, and we have taken measures to ensure the security of user data through encryption and other methods. We hope our platform will be helpful in facilitating the sharing of knowledge among students.

## Tech Stacks

We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. Bootstrap and jQuery were utilized to enhance the user interface and improve functionality.

For back-end development, we used PHP as our server-side scripting language, MySQL as our database management system, and Apache as our web server.

We implemented various algorithms, such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm and cosine similarity algorithm, to improve the search function of our platform.

## Main Features

Our platform has a user-friendly front-end interface that allows users to easily navigate and interact with the system. The home page features tag search, text summarization, and file upload functions. Users can access the alert center and check messages sent by professionals by clicking buttons on the top menu. Users can also do simple searching by typing academic field names in the search box.

The platform includes two types of profile pages: project profile and user profile. Project profile shows system information, while user profile tracks users' usage record.

Our search function is one of the key features of our platform, allowing users to find relevant notes quickly. We implemented various algorithms to improve the search function, including TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm and cosine similarity algorithm.

Overall, our platform provides a centralized location for students to share academic notes and resources with each other in a secure and efficient manner.

## Set-up the Project

To set up the project, install all the required packages for "capturenew.py," which is the algorithm for text summarization.
