Identify Problem Rosedale Golf Course is facing an issue with their existing information system. The current system is only being used by the Accounts Department to process Accounts Payables and Receivables. With the increase in memberships, bookings, and maintenance, the Human Resource department is getting overwhelmed with paperwork.1.2. Understand and Analyze Problems After conducting an initial analysis of the problem, we have identified the following issues:The current system is not able to handle the increased workload.There is a lack of integration between different departments, resulting in duplication of work.The manual paperwork is time-consuming and prone to errors.The existing system is not user-friendly, which leads to a higher learning curve and more errors.The Accounts Department is currently the only one utilizing the system, which leads to a bottleneck.1.3. Estimate Project Cost Based on our initial analysis, we estimate the project cost to be $500,000. This includes the cost of hardware and software, development, testing, training, and maintenance.1.4. Access Project Risk We have identified several risks associated with the project, including:Tight time constraints.Integration with existing systems.User acceptance and adoption of the new system.Technical challenges during development and implementation.Cost overruns.1.5. Propose Solution To address the issues identified, we propose developing a new system that will integrate different departments and automate manual processes. The new system will have the following features:Centralized database for easy access to information.User-friendly interface for ease of use.Automated workflows to reduce manual processes.Integration with existing systems to avoid duplication of work.Access control for better security.1.6. Task Scheduling To meet the tight time constraints, we propose the following schedule:Week 1-2: Requirement gathering and analysis.Week 3-4: Design and development of the new system.Week 5-6: Testing and quality assurance.Week 7: Deployment and training.Week 8-9: Maintenance and support.PHASE 2: REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS2.1. Investigate Current Environment In this phase, we will conduct a thorough investigation of the current environment at Rosedale Golf Course. This will include analyzing the existing information system, interviewing staff members, and observing workflows to identify pain points and areas that need improvement.2.2. Investigate and Define Requirement Based on the findings of the investigation, we will define the requirements for the new system. This will include functional and non-functional requirements, such as user roles and permissions, data storage and retrieval, integration with existing systems, and user interface design.PHASE 3: REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION3.1. Prepare Specification In this phase, we will prepare a detailed specification document that outlines the requirements for the new system. This document will include a description of the system, its features, and its functions, as well as the constraints, assumptions, and risks associated with the project.3.2. Prepare Case Diagram To provide a visual representation of the system and its components, we will create a case diagram. This diagram will show the relationships between different components of the system, such as users, data, and processes.3.3. Prepare Data Dictionary To ensure consistency and accuracy in data storage and retrieval, we will prepare a data dictionary. This dictionary will define the data elements used in the system, their data types, and their relationships.3.4. Prototyping To test the feasibility of the new system and gather user feedback, we will create a prototype. This prototype will be a simplified version of the final system that allows users to interact with the system and provide feedback on its usability and functionality. Based on the feedback received, we will make necessary changes to the system before proceeding to the next phase.PHASE 4: SYSTEM DESIGN4.1. Design New System In this phase, we will design the new system based on the requirements specified in the previous phase. This will include creating a detailed system design document, outlining the system architecture, user interface design, database schema, and workflow diagrams.4.2. Design Test Plan To ensure that the new system meets the functional and non-functional requirements, we will design a test plan. This plan will include test cases and procedures for unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.PHASE 5: CODING AND TESTING5.1. Coding In this phase, we will begin coding the new system based on the design specifications created in the previous phase. We will use industry-standard programming languages and development frameworks to ensure the system is scalable, secure, and maintainable.5.2. Unit Testing To ensure that individual components of the system work as intended, we will conduct unit testing. This testing will be done by the development team and will focus on identifying and fixing bugs and errors in the code.5.3. Integration Testing Once the individual components have been tested, we will proceed to integration testing. This testing will focus on ensuring that the different components of the system work together seamlessly, without any conflicts or errors.5.4. Update Data Dictionary As new data elements are added to the system during the coding and testing phases, we will update the data dictionary to reflect these changes.PHASE 6: SYSTEM TESTING6.1. Hardware and System Testing In this phase, we will conduct hardware and system testing to ensure that the new system works as intended in the production environment. This testing will involve testing the system's performance, scalability, and reliability.6.2. Acceptance Testing To ensure that the new system meets the needs of Rosedale Golf Course, we will conduct acceptance testing. This testing will involve getting feedback from end-users and stakeholders and making any necessary changes based on their feedback.6.3. Prepare Documentation To ensure that the new system is maintainable and easy to use, we will prepare documentation. This will include user manuals, system manuals, and technical documentation for developers and IT staff.Deliverable 3: Resource ManagementOutline of Resource Management for Rosedale Golf Course Project:I.
